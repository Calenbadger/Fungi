# Fungi
This is the github repository for fungal genomics on a fungal pathogen of chickpea (possible Phoma species).  
My involvement in the project began after PacBio RS II data was received, and primarily includes:  
* Genome Assembly
* Genome Annotation
* Phylogenetic Analysis
* Phylogenomic Analyses  

Most of the content/programs were developed specifically for my research and have limited compatibility, so I would not recommend copying/using from this github as of currently.
